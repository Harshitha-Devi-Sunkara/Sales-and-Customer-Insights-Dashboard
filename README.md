# Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard | Tableau Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of two interactive dashboards (Sales Dashboard & Customer Dashboard) using **Tableau**, 
designed to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and trends over a four-year period (2020-2023). 
The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) for both sales and customers, offering valuable insights for business growth and strategy optimization.

## Key Features

### Sales KPIs:
- **Sales**, **Profit**, **Quantity**  
  - Allows for detailed tracking of revenue, profit margins, and sales volume across years.

### Customer KPIs:
- **Orders**, **Customers**, **Sales per Customer**  
  - Provides insights into customer retention, orders placed, and average sales per customer.

### Subcategory Analysis:
- Side-by-side comparison of **sales** and **profit** by subcategory  
  - Identifies high-performing subcategories, helping to optimize product mix and inventory.

### Trend Analysis:
- Weekly trends in **sales** and **customer distribution**  
  - Visualizes fluctuations in sales and customer engagement, enabling proactive adjustments to strategies.

### Customer Segmentation:
- Identification of **top customers** based on sales  
  - Pinpoints the highest-contributing customers, allowing for targeted retention and loyalty programs.

### Time-Based Comparison:
- Monthly KPIs comparison between **current** and **previous years** (2023 vs. 2022, 2022 vs. 2021, etc.)  
  - Enables the identification of year-over-year growth, highlighting areas of improvement or decline.

### Dynamic Features:
- **Filters** to select data by year
- **Benchmarks**: Minimum and maximum values for each KPI
- **% Difference**: Year-over-year growth or decline indicators
- **Dashboard Navigation**: Easy switching between Sales and Customer Dashboards for deeper insights

## Skills & Techniques
- Data visualization and analysis using **Tableau**
- Development of **interactive dashboards** for improved decision-making  
- KPI tracking and trend analysis for **sales** and **customer behavior**
- Data segmentation and **customer insights** for targeted strategies  
- Implementation of **dynamic filters** and **year-over-year comparisons**  
- Comparative analysis and visualization techniques for actionable insights

## Results & Impact:
- **Sales Performance Improvement**: By identifying monthly trends and comparing sales KPIs across years, the project highlights areas of growth or decline, enabling targeted adjustments to sales strategies. For example, a noticeable increase in sales during a specific month or a drop during another is flagged for action.
  
- **Customer Insights**: The identification of **top customers** and the analysis of **sales per customer** helps businesses prioritize high-value clients and improve retention efforts. By visualizing the **distribution of customers**, the dashboard highlights underserved segments or over-saturated markets.

- **Year-over-Year Growth**: The **% difference** and **time-based comparison** reveal growth opportunities, showing whether sales or customer acquisition has increased or declined year-over-year. For instance, the analysis may reveal a 15% growth in sales from 2022 to 2023, providing a concrete indication of business performance.

- **Product and Subcategory Optimization**: By comparing **sales and profit by subcategory**, the dashboard pinpoints which product lines or categories generate the highest margins, leading to informed decisions about inventory and product focus.

- **Operational Efficiency**: The use of **interactive filters** and **benchmarks** (e.g., minimum and maximum KPI values) provides easy navigation of key metrics, significantly reducing the time needed to extract actionable insights from the data.
